## Nail Salon web server

### Developed using:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Bcrypt
- JWT
- MongoDB and Mongoose

### User's story: 
a user can select a type of service offered by the salon, then pick a date and some specific member of the staff to have an appointment with. The user can specify the payment method that will use at the salon, though the service can't be paid on the website. Finally, the user receives a message confirming the appointment information: date, hour, and the name of the chosen staff for the service.
